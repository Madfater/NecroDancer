If the audio is garbled, try altering your audio playback device's "Properties->Advanced->Quality" settings to find a setting that may help.  We use very small audio buffers to reduce latency, and this can cause difficulties on some rare audio hardware configurations.

If the frame rate is low, it may be due to a known bug that is resolved by rebooting your machine.  We are working to correct this.

If the frame rate is still low, it may be because of a strange bug related to "Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receivers".  Try unplugging the USB receiver, or powering-on a controller, then restarting the game.

If the frame rate is STILL low, please try updating your graphics drivers to the latest version.
